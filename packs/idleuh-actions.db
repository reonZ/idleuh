By identifying and empowering the right object, you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters.</p>\n<p>You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness.</p>\n<p><strong>Mortal Weakness</strong> After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Antithesis</strong> You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half your level.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["thaumaturge"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.796,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-14T12:03:54.865+01:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.3.4"}}},"actionType":{"value":"free"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":null},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.tLAbNcNsWB1jk6ET.Item.Py5uarMfZkT8zz6d"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.3.4","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668423834891,"modifiedTime":1668718208316,"lastModifiedBy":"eYRcJxNtWBHDBCJ8"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"CgvhZx5107dfNlEE"}
