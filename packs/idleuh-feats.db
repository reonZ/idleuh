These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric Lore</h2>\n<p>Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to Recall Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.</p>\n<h2>First Implement And Esoterica</h2>\n<p>Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell, chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon). You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p>\n<p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Vulnerability</h3>\n<p>Exploit Vulnerability</p>\n<p>You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Implement's Empowerment</h2>\n<p>The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a thaumaturge class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Second Implement<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've added another implement of power to your toolkit. You choose a second implement, which must be a different type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<p>While you're holding an implement in one hand, you can quickly switch it with another implement you're wearing to use an action from the implement you're switching to. To do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before executing the implement's action. This allows you to meet requirements of having an implement in hand to use its action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your chalice to use its reaction.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturge Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned the secret ways your weapons work most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Implement Adept<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have deepened your connection to one of your implements, unlocking its adept power. Choose one of your implements and gain the adept benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Intensify Vulnerability<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to use your implement to further assault a creature whose vulnerabilities you're exploiting. You gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your implements, as well as the Intensify Vulnerability action.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned deeper secrets of the supernatural, and your abilities are harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<p>You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Adept<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your link to your second implement. You gain the adept benefit of your second implement.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Third Implement<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>As you come closer to the culmination of your journey, you gain your final implement, completing your set of three. It must be a different type of implement than your first and second implements. You gain the initiate benefit and intensify vulnerability benefit of your new implement.</p>\n<h2>Implement Paragon<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have unlocked the last secrets of an implement. Choose one of your implements that already gained the adept benefit; you gain the paragon benefit for that implement.</p>\n<h2>Thaumaturgic Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've become a master in paranormal phenomena, and your esoterica grow in power. Your proficiency rank for your thaumaturge class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>You also gain an additional skill increase, which you can apply only to Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Unlimited Esoterica<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your understanding of your esoterica becomes so complete that you can access your mystic tools without even thinking. You can use Exploit Vulnerability or Intensify Vulnerability as a free action, rather than a single action, though still with a frequency of only once per round.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder

While a weathered book is most common, tome implements can have as many different form factors as there are ways to store knowledge, from carved clay tablets to bundles of knotted cords. Tome implements are associated with the harrow suit of books and the astrological signs of the stargazer and the underworld dragon.</p>\n<h3><strong>Initiate Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>While you hold your tome, lines of text appear on the open pages, revealing useful information. While you hold your tome, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all skill checks to Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you can gain the trained proficiency rank in two skills of your choice until you prepare again. You retain the benefit as long as the tome is on your person, even if you aren't holding it. At 3rd level, you're an expert in one of the skills and trained in the other, and at 5th level, you're an expert in both skills. Since these proficiencies are temporary, you can't use them as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Adept Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the initiate benefits, your tome inscribes insights into creatures that you can use to strike them down. While holding your tome, at the start of your turn each round, attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature of your choice that you're observing. If this check succeeds, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>When you gain temporary skill proficiencies during your daily preparations, one is at expert proficiency and the other at master proficiency. At 9th level, you have master proficiency in both.</p>\n<h3><strong>Intensify Vulnerability</strong></h3>\n<p>Your tome's power not only reads a creature's present but even records its future actions. When you use Intensify Vulnerability, roll a d20 and set the result aside. At any time until the start of your next turn, you can use the d20 result you set aside for an attack roll to Strike the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, instead of rolling a new d20; this is a fortune effect.</p>\n<h3><strong>Paragon Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the other benefits, your tome's information alerts you to ambushes and attacks from your foes. While holding your tome, you can always roll a skill check for initiative against creatures or haunts using Esoteric Lore. If you do, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to your initiative roll.</p>\n<p>The initiate benefit's circumstance bonus to Recall Archive Knowledge from holding your tome increases from +1 to +2. When you succeed at the Recall Knowledge check granted by the tome's adept benefit, the bonus applies to all attack rolls you make before the start of your next turn, not just your next one.

For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Antithesis</strong> You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half your level.</li>\n</ul>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Dark Archive"},"traits":{"value":["thaumaturge"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"value":"Compendium.idleuh.feats.5KzFjPqyLAzOxWlL"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.DK1LCE5pd0YCY11c"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.1vgFGSnn0DIBmK7j"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.AltwHU7hCqTwpn48"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.N6KvTbaRsphc0Ymb"},{"value":"Compendium.idleuh.feats.46l9lfDUxYYOfKNA"},{"value":"Compendium.idleuh.feats.nDE7vTLWj2JNSrcM"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.pDxdE8S8QJV2PGiB"},{"value":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.YiDkrwaxiF7Gao7y"}],"flag":"implement","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.FirstImplement"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.implement}"}],"slug":"first-implement-and-esoterica","schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":1},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":null,"actionCategory":{"value":""}},"type":"feat","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.VSQJtzQE6ikKdsnP"}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1669987312349,"modifiedTime":1672935102002,"lastModifiedBy":"eYRcJxNtWBHDBCJ8"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"xnNSdPxfZ0bU8Ei3"}
